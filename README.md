> Vue.js boilerplate for custom Zendesk apps

## Description

Idea is to create simple Vue.js app to demonstrate how this boilerplate should be used and also serve as base for development of custom Zendesk apps.

## Build setup

``` bash
# To run app locally
npm run start

# To create package
npm run validate
npm run package
```

After running app locally you should append `?zat=true` at the end of the URL of your Zendesk instance.
